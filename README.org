* journal-swap-transclude
Logseq plugin to take a journal entry, move it to a page, and transclude (embed) the reference back to its original location in the journal.

** Why?
So that pages contain the actual content, rather than block references, allowing grep and other simple CLI tools without needing to tie up all those UUID block refs.
